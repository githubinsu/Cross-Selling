# Customer Segmentation for Cross-Selling & Up-Selling

## Objective
The goal of this project is to use category purchase history to segment customers and make cross-selling and up-selling recommendations. Based on the needs of the sales team, we aim to make product recommendations to high-potential customers to encourage cross-selling and up-selling and reduce customer churn.

## Method
The code follows several steps to achieve this goal:

1. Cross-Selling: Identify customers who have purchased from one category and recommend products from related categories that they may also be interested in.
2. Up-Selling: Identify customers who have purchased a certain product and recommend higher-value products that they may also be interested in.
3. Churn Prevention: Identify customers who are at risk of churning and recommend products to encourage them to make another purchase.

## Results
The resulting recommendations represent targeted cross-selling and up-selling suggestions for each customer based on their purchase history. By understanding these segments, we can tailor our marketing and sales strategies to better meet the needs of different groups of customers.
